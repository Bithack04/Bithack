Factions
Warning

This page contains spoilers regarding the game’s story/plot-line.

Throughout the game you may receive invitations from factions. There are many different factions, and each faction has different criteria for determining its potential members. Joining a faction and furthering its cause is crucial to progressing in the game and unlocking endgame content.

It is possible to join multiple factions if you receive invitations from them. However, note that joining a faction may prevent you from joining other rival factions. (Don’t worry, this usually isn’t the case. Also, it would only be temporary since resetting the game by installing Augmentations will clear all your factions)

The ‘Factions’ link on the menu brings up a list of all factions that you have joined. You can select a Faction on this list to go to that Faction page. This page displays general information about the Faction and also lets you perform work for the faction. Working for a Faction is similar to working for a company except that you don’t get paid a salary. You will only earn reputation in your Faction and train your stats. Also, cancelling work early when working for a Faction does not result in reduced reputation earnings.

Warning
